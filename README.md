# Account Abstraction (zkSync)

With this Foundry project you can create a simple Account Abstraction (AA) contract. It is designed for networks with native AA like zkSync. It was made for the Advanced Foundry course of Cyfrin Updraft.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry-zksync](https://foundry-book.zksync.io/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.0.2`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/RicardoPintos/account-abstraction-zksync
cd account-abstraction-zksync
forge build --zksync --system-mode=true
```

<br>

# Usage

## Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

- [Openzeppelin-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
- [Cyfrin-foundry-era-contracts](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-era-contracts)
- [Foundry-forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)

You can install all of them with the following Makefile command:

```
make install
```

## Testing

To run every test:

```
forge test --zksync --system-mode=true
```

## Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```

# Deploy

The deployment process on zkSync is more complex compared to other networks. In the Cyfrin Updraft course, they provided a suite of Yarn scripts for deployment, but the course did not explain how these scripts work in detail. Including those scripts in this repository might give the impression that I fully understand them, which I do not. 

Therefore, I am instead referencing the [zkSync Deployment section](https://github.com/Cyfrin/minimal-account-abstraction?tab=readme-ov-file#deploy---zksync-local-network) from the original repository. That documentation explains how to deploy to both a local node and a live network.
